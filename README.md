# Link Preview Generator

A simple tool to generate HTML embed code for URL previews. Ideal for platforms like Squarespace that donâ€™t reliably auto-generate URL previews.

## Features
- Extracts Open Graph metadata from URLs to create HTML embed code.

- Offers both a standalone executable for easy use and the Python source code for customization.
